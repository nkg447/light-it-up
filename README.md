# Light It up
Tuya control over the cloud

This Node.js API allows you to control your Tuya / Smart Life Devices by just passing your email and password, that you are using in the Tuya/Smart Life app. This library is using an Tuya API endpoint, that was specially designed for Home Assistant.

A good reference of the capibilities is the [tuyaha project](https://github.com/PaulAnnekov/tuyaha), which actually is a library, written in python.


## Get Started

- Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- Clone repository
- `cd` to repository folder
- Run `npm i`
- Create a `keys.json` file (see example below)
- Run `node example.js`

This example will turn off the first device you've set up in Tuya / Smart Life. Also a `devices.json` file will get created with a list of all your devices and it's current state.

### How to call the API

The following shows a basic script how you can turn on a lamp and set it's brightness

```javascript
const api = new CloudTuya({
  userName: apiKeys.userName,
  password: apiKeys.password,
  bizType: apiKeys.bizType,
  countryCode: apiKeys.countryCode,
  region: apiKeys.region,
});
await api.login();

deviceId = devices[0].id;

var myLight =  new Light({ api: api, deviceId: deviceId});

myLight.turnOn();
myLight.setBrightness(80);
var brightness = await myLight.getBrightness();
```

## Example Files

### Example Script showing how to use cloudtuya

Take a look at the `example.js` file, to see how to call the cloudtuya API.

### Example `keys.json`

```javascript
{
  "userName": "YOURSMARTLIFEEMAIL",
  "password": "YOURSMARTLIFEPASSWORD",
  "bizType": "smart_life",
  "countryCode": "44",
  "region": "eu"
}
```

The following values are available

- **bizType**: *tuya, smart_life*
- **countryCode**: Enter the [country calling code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes) from your country, e.g. 44
- **region**: *az* (Americas), *ay* (Asia), *eu* (Europe), *us* (United States)
